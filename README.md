# threadpool

My (rather naive) implementation (see [main.rs](https://github.com/jinjagit/threadpool/blob/main/src/bin/main.rs)) of Ryan Levicks's Rust threadpool library (see [lib.rs](https://github.com/jinjagit/threadpool/blob/main/src/lib.rs)), from [his tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mwwYbBRJSo).  

Learning to use Arc, Mutex, Atomic variables, and developing understanding of ownership, borrowing and closures.
